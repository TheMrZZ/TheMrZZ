### Hello 👋

I am a software, data engineer and an entrepreneur. I love working on new challenges.

- I now work at Kradle AI - the future of models evaluation, alongside the founder of Firebase & Tensorflow's former product lead. More coming soon!

- I owned the Data Infrastructure of Alan, the one-stop health assistant that covers all your neers - from insurance to health. 

- I've been the CEO of [Keplair](https://www.keplair.com) for quite some time. I learned more than I could ever have dreamed of.

- 🛠 I am the creator & maintainer of [Sandstone](https://www.sandstone.dev), an open-source framework for Minecraft Datapacks generation.

- 🤖 I love AI. It's basically my hobby.

- 📧 Wanna talk? Reach me on Discord: [TheMrZZ#9307](https://discord.com/users/113963629535035392), or at [contact@ernst.app](mailto:contact@ernst.app).
